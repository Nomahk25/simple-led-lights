# Arduino Line Following Robot (Wokwi Simulation)

## üì∏ Project Image
![Project Demo](./led_light.png)

This project is a **Line Following Robot** built with Arduino and simulated using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).  
It uses IR sensors to detect the line and control the robot‚Äôs movement accordingly.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Arduino Uno based
- IR sensors for line detection
- Motor driver for controlling wheels
- Circuit schematic included (`diagram.json`)
- Ready to run in **Wokwi Simulator**

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or Wokwi account
- Basic knowledge of C++/Arduino programming
- Git for version control

### Running on Wokwi
1. Upload the project files (`sketch.ino`, `diagram.json`, `wokwi-project.txt`) to Wokwi.
2. Open the `sketch.ino` file.
3. Click **Run** ‚ñ∂ to start the simulation.

### Running on Arduino Hardware
1. Upload `sketch.ino` to an **Arduino Uno** board.
2. Connect IR sensors and motor driver as shown in `diagram.json`.
3. Power up and place the robot on a track.
